PROJECT TITLE: Tic Tac Toe Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To design a Tic Tac Toe Game that allows two players (one human and one computer) to alternate placing marks in a 3X3 board. The first player, who's respective mark is X, is decided by a coin toss. A win is achieved by filling a row, a column, or a diagonal with one kind of mark. If neither player can achieve a win, the game ends with a tie.
VERSION or DATE: 4/16/2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run TicTacToeRunner class the begin the game. Play the game until a win or tie is achieved. Type Y to begin a fresh game, and n to quit. Enjoy!

<pros>: This was by far the best project I have ever done. Words cannot describe the joy I had while completing this project. I am planning on further working on this program during later holidays and the summer in order to add time delays between player move's, computer move's, and diplays of the board. 

I am also planing on adding sound effects and a seperate multiplayer mode. Perhaps, by next year, I would be able to create an app that uses the code I created and graphics and sfx from the MIT free app creater. The possibilities are limitless, and I am sure I would have an immeasurable amount of fun throughout it all.

<cons>: I had difficulty making sure the comments which were in the files provided for the project were not lackluster and confusing. However, as I read through the comments now, I can see that each and every method and class is well explained.
